# Tab Switcher Extension

This is a simple Chrome extension designed to enhance your tab navigation experience by allowing you to switch between the current tab and the last active tab using the keyboard shortcut Alt+Q.

## Features

- Switch between the current tab and the last active tab with a single keyboard shortcut.
- Persistent tab tracking even after browser restart.
- Always remembers your last active tab for reliable switching.
- Works 24/7 on any website.
- Lightweight and easy to use.

## Installation

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Microsoft Edge and navigate to `edge://extensions`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory where the extension files are located.
5. The Tab Switcher extension should now be installed and active.

## Usage

- To switch between the current tab and the last active tab, simply press `Alt+Q`.
- The extension automatically tracks which tabs you've been using, so Alt+Q will always do something useful.

## How It Works

The extension continuously monitors your tab activity and:
- Tracks your currently active tab and previously active tab
- Persists this information even if you restart your browser
- Handles cases where tabs might be closed or no longer exist
- Provides fallback options to ensure Alt+Q always performs a tab switch
